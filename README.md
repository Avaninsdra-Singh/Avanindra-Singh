# Arduino Servo Motor Control with Distance Measurement

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor's angle based on distance measurements using an ultrasonic sensor with Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Jumper wires

## Wiring Diagram
Add your wiring diagram here (if available).

## Instructions
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor's trig pin to Arduino pin 9, echo pin to Arduino pin 10.
2. Connect the servo motor's signal pin to Arduino pin 11.
3. Upload the `servo_distance_control.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
4. Open the serial monitor to view distance measurements and observe the servo motor's movement based on distance.

## Additional Features
- Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor.
- Servo motor angle control based on distance.
- (Optional) Motor control based on distance.
